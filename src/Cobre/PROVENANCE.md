# Provenance of the vendored Cobre policy readers

These 12 modules are **generated code, vendored verbatim**. They are never edited: not to satisfy
`ruff`, not to satisfy `mypy`, not to add annotations. `pyproject.toml` excludes this directory from
both tools for exactly that reason. To change anything here, regenerate from the schema and update
the digests below.

## Upstream

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Schema | `crates/cobre-io/schemas/policy.fbs` |
| Namespace | `Cobre.IO.Policy` |
| FlatBuffers file identifier | `CBVF` |
| Checkpoint `format_version` | 1 |
| Source case | `/home/carlosribeiro/git/DEC_ONS_052026_RV0_VE_CONVERTIDO` |
| Source subdirectory | `Cobre/` |
| Copied | 2026-09-04 |

The import path is `Cobre.IO.Policy.<Module>`. It is deliberately **not** nested under
`conversor_fcf`: both the generated modules and the reference case rely on that exact path.

## Modules

Paths are relative to this directory. Every digest was verified identical to its counterpart in the
source case at the time of copying, and re-verified after the tree was relocated from the repository
root to `src/`.

The three `__init__.py` files are empty, which is why they share the sha256 of the empty input.

## Consumed by

`src/conversor_fcf/cobre/policy_reader.py` materializes `CheckpointManifest` and `StageCuts` into
frozen dataclasses at the reader boundary; no live FlatBuffers table travels deeper into the
package. `StageBasis` and `StageStates` are vendored for completeness and are not consumed by the
conversion.
